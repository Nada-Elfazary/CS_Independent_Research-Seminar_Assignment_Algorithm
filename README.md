# CS-Seminar-Assignment-Project

To use the web application:

- Browse to: https://iw-seminar-assignment-generation.onrender.com
- The deployed web application uses the ILP algorithm

To run the greedy algorithm (locally):

- Install the required Python packages from the command line using the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt

- In index.html, line 17, change the action attribute from "/ilp" to "/greedy" 

- Run the backend.py file using the following command or a similar one: python backend.py

- Copy the port from the terminal and paste it in the web browser


To test the algorithms on previous data:


- Use the data instances for each semester found in the 'IW Test Data' folder
- The files that contain "Sign Up Information" in their title are to be uploaded as the first CSV file


Ownership: I wrote all the code in the repository
